# trafalgar_landing_page
I transformed a concept web page from a Figma design file into a functional website. My initial approach was to design for desktop and then adapt it for other devices. This website utilizes newer CSS 3 features such as flex-box and grid layout for responsiveness. I also used the BEM method for naming CSS classes to organize the code and make it easy to understand.
